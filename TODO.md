## Priority Order for MVP Launch
1. Database schema
2. Google OAuth and Gmail integration
3. PDF invoice extraction
4. Duplicate detection (exact matches)
5. Basic frontend dashboard
6. Email notification system
7. Google Workspace Marketplace listing

## Notes
- Start with PDF-only support (no OCR) for MVP
- Focus on exact duplicate detection first
- Weekly email digests are critical for user retention
- Free trial â†’ paid conversion is the key metric
